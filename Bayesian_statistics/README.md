# Bayesian statistics

This repository is intended to summarize the  most important concepts of the mysterious field of Bayesian statistics.

My hope is, that with the help of my explanations and the materials I link here, I will be able to spread the amazing view, how a bayesian statistician sees the world.

The structure of each folder is the following:  

- R or python script with the solution of the given problem, without any explanation
- markdown file with (almost) line by line explanation of the solution in the README.md file. 

Of course, for larger scripts or projects the description is in a seperate markdown file and the README.md serves its original purpose.
