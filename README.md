# Overview
This repository contains an overview about the most interesting topics from my studies and first practical experiences to demonstrate the range of fields I am interested in. With this repository I intend three things:

* to provide a reference for the student of any quantitative program,
* to provide a quick summary about my knowledge for my future applications,
* and, most importantly, to provide an overseeable summary for myself (i.e. a cheatsheet for me :) ).

I hope, I can reach my goals with the help of the repository.

#### Disclaimer

Some of the solutions represented in this repository is the result of a teamwork of me and my other student or working colleagues. Some of the explanations of the underlying theory was written with the help of the study materials received during the Quantitative Finance Master Program of the WU University Vienna.
