# Overview
This repository contains an overview about the most interesting topics from my studies and first practical experiences to demonstrate the range of fields I am interested in. With this repository I intend three things:

* to provide a reference for the student of any quantitative program,
* to provide a quick summary about my knowledge for my future applications,
* and, most importantly, to provide an overseeable summary for myself (i.e. a cheatsheet for me :) ).

I hope, I can reach my goals with the help of the repository.

# My months by Trality
I have learned a lot about development, advanced algorithms, technical writing and overall about the "start up life" thanks to the unique opportunity of being part of the team of [Trality](trality.com) from the very beginning of the development of the platform.
A, by far not total, summary of my contribution to the platform can be read in the [documentation of Trality](https://docs.trality.com) under the sections
* [Built-in strategies](https://docs.trality.com/api-documentation/built-in-strategies)
* [Portfolio optimization](https://docs.trality.com/api-documentation/portfolio-optimization)
* [Portfolio rebalancing](https://docs.trality.com/api-documentation/portfolio-rebalancing)

Of course, the implementation of these advanced algorithms cannot be published on my private profile.

Please note, that besides the implementation of the algorithms, described in the above mentioned part of the documentation, the documentation itself was written by me.

# About myself
To have an overview about my career path and skills I can recommend you to visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlo-marton-28b175131/) and go over the materials I shared here on github.

To get some feelings about my personality, I am open everytime for a beer! :) 


#### Disclaimer

Some of the solutions represented in this repository are the results of teamwork of me and my student or working colleagues. Some of the explanations of the underlying theory was written with the help of the study materials received and learned during the [Quantitative Finance Master Program of the WU University Vienna](https://www.wu.ac.at/studium/master/quantitative-finance/overview).
