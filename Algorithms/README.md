# Cool algorithms

This repository is intended to collect and show some interesting and/or tricky algorithms I came over during my studies and work in order to keep them as 
* reference for my future,
* and simply just reminders for me! :) 

I hope, you will find these scripts also interesting/tricky and you can find some useful information in these scripts.


The structure of each folder is the following:  
- R or python script with the solution of the given problem, without any explanation
- markdown file with (almost) line by line explanation of the solution in the README.md file. 

Of course, for larger scripts or projects the description is in a seperate markdown file and the README.md serves its original purpose.
