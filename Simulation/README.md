# Simulation

The sections is focused on different techniques to simulate random variables. These techniques range from the simple ones, such as _inverse transform_ to the more practical _Monte Carlo (MC) method_, included some ways to decrease the variance of the _MC simulation_. Furthermore, the simulation of _stochastic differential equations (SDE)_ is covered shortly as well.
