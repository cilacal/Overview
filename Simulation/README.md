# Simulation

This repository is intended to collect and show the most interesting ideas and methods from the broad field of simulation (mostly with examples from finance) in order to 
* have a reference,
* and simply just reminders for me! :) 

I hope, you will find these ideas and their implementation also interesting and useful.


The structure of each folder is the following:  
- R or python script with the solution of the given problem, without any explanation
- markdown file with (almost) line by line explanation of the solution in the README.md file. 

Of course, for larger scripts or projects the description is in a seperate markdown file and the README.md serves its original purpose.
